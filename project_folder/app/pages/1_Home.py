st.write("""- A machine learning model was trained on historical loan data using techniques such as:
  - **StandardScaler** for normalization
  - **One-hot encoding** for categorical variables
  - **Linear Regression** for risk score prediction
  - Multiple classification algorithms (e.g., GaussianNB, Random Forest, KNN, LinearSVC) for loan approval
- The model takes into account 23 features including income, credit score, debt ratios, loan purpose, and more.
- A FastAPI backend handles predictions, and this Streamlit frontend allows for easy data input and visualization.""")
