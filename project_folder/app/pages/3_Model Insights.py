_How It Works:_
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Categorical inputs are encoded using one-hot encoding.
   - Numerical inputs are standardized using a trained scaler.
            
2. **Model Training**:
   - **Linear Regression** is used for continuous risk scoring.
   - **LinearSVC** is used for binary loan approval classification.
   - Other models (Naive Bayes, KNN, Random Forest) were evaluated, but LinearSVC performed best.

3. **Model Outputs**:
   - A **risk score** (e.g., 0.48)
   - A **loan decision**: ‚ÄúApprove‚Äù or ‚ÄúDeny‚Äù

1. **Predicted Risk Score**: The risk score predicted by the model for each loan application. Values range from approximately 36.78 to 74.80.

2. **Predicted Status**: The loan decision based on the predicted risk score ("Deny!" or `"Approve!"`).

3. **Actual Risk Score**: The true risk score for the loan application, as determined by actual outcomes. Values range from approximately 36 to 73.

4. **Accuracy Rating (%)**: A calculated metric comparing the predicted and actual risk scores.

            1. Class Imbalance:
The dataset may have far more ~"Denied"~ or `"Approved"` cases, causing the model to favor the majority class.
            
2. Outcome Mismatches:
Row 31 shows a prediction errors (false denial), which may indicate model inaccuracies or feature-normalization misalignment.

3. Model Drift:
The model is static after training, which may lead to scaling/threshold issues, leading to potential poor model performance.

st.markdown("""
1. **Review Mismatches**: Investigate rows where predictions failed (e.g., false denials).  
            
2. **Scheduled Retraining**: Periodically retrain the model with new, recent data.
            
3. **Resampling Techniques**: Undersample the majority class (_Denied_) if oversampling inflates training size too much.
